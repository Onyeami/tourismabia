                <p class="state">
                    <!-- Historical information about Abia State -->
                    <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Abia" target="_blank">Abia State</a> is located in the
                    the southeastern part of Nigeria has a rich and diverse history. The state was created on August 27,
                    1991, from part of the former Imo State during the administration of General Ibrahim Babangida. Since its
                    creation, Abia State has experienced significant growth and development across various sectors.

                    <p>
                        The history of Abia State dates back to the pre-colonial era when various ethnic groups inhabited the
                        region. The main indigenous groups are the Igbo people, including the Ngwa, Abiriba, and Bende
                        subgroups. These groups had vibrant socio-economic and political structures that contributed to the
                        region's development.
        
                        During the colonial era, Abia State, along with other parts of present-day southeastern Nigeria, fell
                        under British control. The region was administered as part of the Eastern Region and later the East
                        Central State after Nigeria gained independence in 1960.
        
                        After the creation of Abia State in 1991, the state's capital is located in Umuahia. Aba is a major
                        commercial and industrial city in the state. Aba has since played a significant role in the state's
                        economic growth, serving as a hub for trade, manufacturing, and entrepreneurship.
        
                        Abia State is renowned for its entrepreneurial spirit, with a thriving private sector that contributes
                        to the state's economy. Industries such as textiles, footwear manufacturing, food processing, and
                        plastics have flourished in Aba, earning it the nickname "Aba made."
        
                        The state has also made significant strides in education, with the establishment of various tertiary
                        institutions, including Abia State University, Michael Okpara University of Agriculture, and Abia State
                        Polytechnic.
        
                        In terms of governance, Abia State has had several administrations since its creation, each making
                        efforts to drive development, infrastructure, and social welfare programs.
        
                        Abia State is known for its cultural heritage, vibrant festivals, and artistic traditions. The state
                        celebrates the colorful New Yam Festival (Iri-Ji) and other cultural events that showcase the richness
                        of Igbo culture.
        
                        Overall, Abia State has evolved into a dynamic and economically vibrant state, fostering growth in
                        various sectors and contributing to Nigeria's socio-cultural fabric. The resilience and entrepreneurial
                        spirit of its people have played a pivotal role in the state's progress, making it a significant part of
                        Nigeria's history and development.

                        Wasn’t quite sure what brought me to Nigeria last December. So one of my friends informed me
